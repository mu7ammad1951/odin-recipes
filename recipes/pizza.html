        <h2>A pepperoni pizza</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>For the sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 can tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp. onion powder</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp. red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tsps. white sugar</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the dough:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tbsp. olive oil</li>
            <li>1 package refrigerated pizz dough</li>
            <li>1 pound low moisture mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>3 1/2 ounces thick pepperoni slices</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add tomato paste, garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, basil, oregano, salt, and sugar. Saute until the tomato paste starts to caramelize on the bottom of the pan, 3 to 4 minutes. </li>
            <li>Pour in water and whisk to combine; bring to a simmer. Lower the heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces to your desired thickness. Turn off the heat and reserve until needed. </li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Generously grease a sheet pan with olive oil, rubbing some on your fingers as well. </li>
            <li>Press, stretch, and pull pizza dough until it fills the prepared pan, going all the way to the corners. If the dough stops stretching, let it rest for 5 minutes before resuming. </li>
            <li>Top dough with cooled sauce, spreading all the way to the edges of the pan. Sprinkle on mozzarella cheese and add pepperoni. Place the pan on the stove over a high flame, and slowly move it around to evenly apply the heat, until you hear it starting to sizzle, about 1 minute. </li>
            <li>Transfer into the lower center of the preheated oven and bake until cheese is beautifully browned and pepperoni is charred, about 20 minutes. Slice and serve. </li>
        </ol>
